# Maruti Suzuki Accelerator Jury Portal

This project is a responsive, tablet-style jury evaluation interface developed for the **Maruti Suzuki Accelerator Program**. Designed with an iPad Pro 11 layout in mind, the portal allows jury members to scroll through a list of startup logos, view dynamically changing "Now Presenting" headers, and input evaluation scores in a structured scorecard format.
